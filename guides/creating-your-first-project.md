## The mindmap concept

_A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize information in a hierarchy, showing relationships among pieces of the whole. It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. - \<Wikipedia>_

Ok, cool now tell me how can we utilize it for offensive security? Pretty simple, we need to define what techniques to use and which tools will deliver quick results.

Since enumeration is critical for succeding in a penetration testing, let's define a mindmap that can help to circle back in case of doubt or being stuck.

#### How to create a mindmap with Obsidian

1. Install Obsidian: Download and install Obsidian on your computer from the official Obsidian website ([https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)). Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management tool that supports the creation of interconnected notes.
2. Set Up Your Vault: Open Obsidian and create a new vault or open an existing one. A vault is a folder where your notes are stored. Organize your vault structure in a way that makes sense for your mapping needs.
3. Create Notes: Create individual notes for each concept or topic that you want to include in your map. Each note will represent a node or point on the map.
4. Link Your Notes: Use Obsidian's linking feature to connect your notes together. In each note, you can create links to other relevant notes using double brackets \[\[note title]]. This establishes a connection between the notes.
5. Visualize Connections: To create a visual map, you can use the Graph View feature in Obsidian. Open the Graph View by clicking on the graph icon in the left sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+G). The Graph View will display a visual representation of the connections between your notes.
6. Customize the Map: In the Graph View, you can customize the appearance of your map by adjusting settings such as layout, color, and node size. Experiment with different layouts and configurations to find a style that suits your preferences.
7. Navigate the Map: In the Graph View, you can interact with the map by dragging and zooming. Clicking on a node will open the corresponding note, allowing you to explore the content further.
8. Refine and Update: As you continue to create and link notes, regularly revisit your map and update it accordingly. Obsidian's Graph View will dynamically reflect changes in your note connections, ensuring your map stays up to date.
9. Export or Share: You can export or share your map in various ways. Obsidian allows you to export your notes and the associated graph as a PDF or image file. Additionally, you can use plugins or extensions to generate more advanced visualizations or share your map online.
