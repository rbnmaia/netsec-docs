# X86

The C programming is a high level language interpreted by the compiler that converts code into machine instructions called assembly language. By using a disassembler tool we can get the assembly language of a compiled C program.

The Intel 8086 and 8088 were the first CPUs to have an instruction set that is now commonly referred to as **x86**. Intel Architecture 32-bit (IA-32) sometimes also called i386 is the 32-bit version of the x86 instruction set architecture.

The x86 architecture is **little-endian**, meaning that multi-byte values are written least significant byte first.

**How we see it:**

```
| A0 | A1 | A2 | A3 |
```

**Stored as Little Endian**

```
| A3 | A2 | A1 | A0 |
```

### Opcodes and Instructions

Each Instruction represents opcodes (hex code) that tell the machine what to do next.

Three categories of instructions:

* Data Movement/Access
* Arithmetic / Logic
* Control-Flow

#### Common Instructions

* **mov, lea** (data movement, data access)
* **add, sub** (arithmetic)
* **or, and, xor** (Logic)
* **shr, shl** (Logic)
* **ror, rol** (Logic)
* **jmp, jne, jnz, jnb** (Control Flow)
* **push, pop, call, leave, enter, ret** (Control Flow)

Example below is moving value at 0xaaaaaaaa into ecx.

| <p><strong><code>Instruction</code></strong></p><p><code>mov ecx,[0xaaaaaaaa];</code></p> | <p><strong><code>Opcode</code></strong></p><p><code>8B 0D AA AA AA AA</code></p> |
